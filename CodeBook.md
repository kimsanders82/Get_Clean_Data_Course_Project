## Data Description:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

1. tBodyAcc-XYZ
2. tGravityAcc-XYZ
3. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
4. tBodyGyro-XYZ
5. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
6. tBodyAccMag
7. tGravityAccMag
8. tBodyAccJerkMag
9. tBodyGyroMag
10. tBodyGyroJerkMag
11. fBodyAcc-XYZ
12. fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
13. fBodyGyro-XYZ
14. fBodyAccMag
15. fBodyAccJerkMag
16. fBodyGyroMag
17. fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

1. mean(): Mean value
2. std(): Standard deviation
3. mad(): Median absolute deviation 
4. max(): Largest value in array
5. min(): Smallest value in array
6. sma(): Signal magnitude area
7. energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
8. iqr(): Interquartile range 
9. entropy(): Signal entropy
10. arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
11. correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
12. maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
13. meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
14. skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
15. kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
16. bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
17. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

1. gravityMean
2. tBodyAccMean
3. tBodyAccJerkMean
4. tBodyGyroMean
5. tBodyGyroJerkMean
